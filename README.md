# ng_net_cs
A project made using Angular as front-end, C# as back-end programming language set in Dot Net Framework using SQL Server as Database.
Will be making changes over the time, its my practice project. Anyone can use the code, this is being developed on Macbook with different tools installed to support .net framework, sql server as they are native to Windows plateform but not to MacOs.
